# PlaceWithEase
The purpose of PlaceWithEase is to provide a website for an institution where
the seniors can share their strategy for preparations, study materials, relevant
resources, experience of interviews/online test of various companies for
placements and answer to queries of juniors. With this project it is intended to
make a platform where seniors can help juniors for preparation for placements
and strategies to study for semesters in general.
Students face difficulty in preparations especially for interviews/ online tests
for companies during placements. When it comes to preparation, the best
people who can help are seniors but interaction between junior and seniors is
not an easy task especially when online. There are various platforms where
interaction can take place but they are not especially designed for this purpose
but what if there is a platform exclusively designed for this purpose? Things
would be much easier and efficient. So this is a web based application
exclusively designed for the interaction between senior and juniors of the
particular institution.
